Introduction:
    This is HCC code for demonstrating the usage of registers as buffer in
    stencils. Before computation, each workitem will first load the target data
    into their own registers. Then, during the computation, each workitem will
    fetch its neighbor data from their "friend" workitem. In this folder, we
    have two sample codes of 2D-9points and 3D-27points. The use of registers as
    buffer relies on the hardware-supported functionality of data permutation
    among register files.

Execution:
    1. Choose right application in buildrun.sh
        APP=demo3d: run the 3D-27points 
        APP=demo2d: run the 2D-9points
        DTYPE=float: use float data  
        DTYPE=double: use double data 
    2. Run the compilation and generated binary 
        sh buildrun.sh
    3. The performance results of GFLOPS and Throughput(GB/s) will be shown.
